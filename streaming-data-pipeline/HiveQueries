# Queries for building Hive tables

## Build the table

```
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS dward.reviews_csv(
  marketplace STRING,
  customer_id INTEGER,
  review_id STRING,
  product_id STRING,
  product_parent STRING,
  product_title STRING,
  product_category STRING,
  helpful_votes INTEGER,
  total_votes INTEGER,
  vine STRING,
  verified_purchase STRING,
  review_headline STRING,
  review_body STRING,
  review_date STRING,
  username STRING,
  name STRING,
  sex STRING,
  birthdate STRING,
  mail STRING
  )
  PARTITIONED BY (
    star_rating STRING
  )
  ROW FORMAT
    DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY "\t"
    ESCAPED BY "\\"
    LINES TERMINATED BY "\n"
  STORED AS TEXTFILE
  LOCATION "/user/dward/reviews_csv/"
  ```

  Also, we need to run this to tell it to get the data from the partition folders:
  ```
  MSCK REPAIR TABLE reviews_csv
  ```
